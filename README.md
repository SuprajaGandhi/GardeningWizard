# GardeningWizard
Gardening Wizard is a mobile application for gardening enthusiasts. The motivation behind the application is to create a one-place solution for all gardening needs.

●	Plant Library: Plant Library contains the prototype of the real-time data. It includes a comprehensive list of plants that can be grown indoors. Basic information like common name, scientific name and image is added about each plant.

●	Add to list: There is an option to add to list next to each plant entry to the wishlist of the user. Once the plant is added to the wishlist, the button changes to an unclickable state to avoid duplicate entries.

●	Plant profile: On clicking each plant in the list, the complete profile of the plant is loaded. It contains information about soil mixture, water needs, best time to sow and harvest.

●	User profile: User profile contains user name, brief bio, and wish list. Reminder icon at the top right corner allows the user to set reminders to water their plants.

●	Q&A forum: Q&A sections allow the user to interact with other gardeners. It is organized as two tabs: one for posting their questions and another for answering the queries asked by others.

●	Menu bar: There is a menu bar at the bottom of the app to easily navigate between the home page, user profile and Q&A section.
